# Changelog

## 2.0.0

### Multi-Window Editing!!

You can now edit in one screen and view your PDF in another! Do so by maximizing the editor side, and the recompile button will be moved over! 

There is no "Download" button for the PDF anymore - click on the "open" icon in the editor pane to view the PDF and download it from there, all within Overleaf Desktop!

### All New Icon!

The leaf looks less...... amateur. I always liked the original Overleaf logo, but this vectorized leaf will have to do.

### More Stability / Less Crashes

### Automated building using GitHub Actions
