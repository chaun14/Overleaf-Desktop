## Overview:

Overleaf Desktop is a *free* dedicated [Overleaf](https://v2.overleaf.com/) desktop application (available on the Ubuntu App / Snap Store!). For those who don't know, Overleaf is a GoogleDocs-like editor for LaTeX documents, allowing groups to modify the same document and more!

This app aims to provide a seamless experience for users, allowing them to close Chrome and concentrate *just* on writing -- no need for distracting or having your bookmarks and other tabs ready to distract you!
